# MaryForward Website (Next.js + Tailwind)

This is a starter marketing site mirroring an Outcomes4Me-style structure:
- Learn hub (condition explainers)
- Audience pages (patients, clinicians, partners)
- Company pages (story, compliance, pricing)
- Login/Signup CTAs (placeholders)

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Notes
- Logo integrated in the navigation (`public/maryforward-logo.png`).
- “In honor of Mary” tone included on Home + Our Story + Footer.
- Forms are demo stubs (alerts). Replace with your CRM/email backend in production.
